EENG30006_2022: Year 3 Group Project 


Main Tasks:

Ball tracking algorithm (image processing)	
      • Machine learning 		
	        • Painting the ball a specific colour (different from the vbase board colour)
	        • Feeding the algorithm with ball pictures (ball that moves)
          
Moving the base board	
    • Mechanics 		
	        • Design 1: Actuators in the corners. 
	        • Design 2: Axis down the middle, twisting knob
	  • Physics system (software)
	        • Compute position, speed, acceleration
	        
Puzzle Design Algorithm 	
    • Machine Learning 		
	        • Recognize the black path taken by the ball
	        • Guide the ball through the path, linking ball tracking algorithm
          
Physical Assembly	
    • Glue things together		
	  • Soldering
